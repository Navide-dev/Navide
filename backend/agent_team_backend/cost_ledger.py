"""Per-call AI usage ledger: the durable record AI development cost is computed from.

One row per model call in ``usage_calls`` (navide.db), keyed on
``(vendor, dedup_key)`` — the dedup key the vendor's log reader already
composes (claude: ``message.id::requestId``; other vendors' keys are prefixed
with the log file, see ledger_key). Writes are INSERT OR IGNORE, so a
replay, a backfill or a crash-and-reread of the same log never counts a call
twice, and any log can be re-ingested safely.

Unlike the tokens.* documents in tokens_store, rows keep the session, the
transcript's own cwd, the model and the four-way token split, which is what a
dollar figure needs. Dollars are never stored: they are computed at query time
from the versioned ``cost_pricing.json``, so a price change re-prices history
without the raw logs. Once a call is here its raw log is no longer needed to
answer "what did this cost".

``usage_daily`` is a view over ``usage_calls`` (day × cwd × vendor × model), so
it can never drift from the rows it sums.

``pane_sessions`` (schema 2) maps each pane to the sessions it ran, written
with every call that names a pane. Rows that name no pane (a backfill, a call
read before its pane claimed the session) take their session's pane from it,
and cost_report compares the two views per pane.

``profile_id`` (schema 3) is the account slot the call ran on, as the token
sink attributed it; '' when unknown. It is stored as an opaque string and never
interpreted here. Upgrading to schema 3 fills it for the last 30 days of rows
whose log lives under a Navide claude profile dir (see profile_from_path).
