/**
 * cliLaunchOverride.ts
 *
 * The two per-vendor launch overrides a user can set by hand: the whole
 * command line, and extra environment variables.
 *
 * Scope is GLOBAL for both, matching `agentTeam.cliPermission.<key>` and
 * `agentTeam.cliModel.<key>`. How a CLI is
 * invoked follows the machine it is installed on, not whichever folder happens
 * to be open.
 *
 * Kept apart from cliModelDefault.ts because they answer to different owners:
 * a model pick is a request Navide assembles into argv, whereas a command
 * override means "I am writing the command line myself" — Navide stops adding
 * to it, model and effort included. That is existing behaviour in
 * `resolveCommand` (a non-empty override returns verbatim); this module only
 * gives it a stored value to read, so the UI has to say so out loud.
 *
 * Values are NOT validated here beyond shape. A command is whatever the user's
 * shell accepts, and an env value is opaque; the only rule enforced is that an
 * env NAME looks like one, because a name with an `=` or a space cannot be put
 * into a process environment at all.
